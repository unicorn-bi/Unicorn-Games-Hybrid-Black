# Brainbuddy

Developed during a BCI game jam 2022 for impaired children, this platformer game utilizes a brain-computer interface (BCI) for control. Players can engage in multiplayer mode, with one player controlling the character via keyboard input and the other using the BCI. Alternatively, the game can be played solo by simultaneously controlling the character with both the keyboard and BCI. The objective is to collect fruits scattered throughout the game world. Success relies on effectively coordinating control between the BCI and keyboard, making it necessary to master both input methods to complete the game. This inclusive and challenging gaming experience encourages cognitive and motor skill development while fostering cooperation in multiplayer gameplay.

## Open 'Brainbuddy' from Unicorn Suite Hybrid Black

<img src="./img/g10.png" alt="drawing" width="700"/><br/>
</p>

Upon accessing the screen, you will find detailed instructions on how to maneuver the characters. You are presented with two options. You can either play solo utilizing the Brain-Computer Interface (BCI), where you focus on flashing objects to initiate actions. Simultaneously, you can use the keyboard for character movement, employing the W/A/S/D or Left/Right/UP/Down keys. Pressing the Up key (W) propels the character into a jump, while the left (A) and right (D) keys dictate directional movement. You can also play with a friend. So one person is using the BCI and the other one uses the keyboard.

# Platformer

In this unique platformer game, players must simultaneously control both the keyboard and a brain-computer interface (BCI) to successfully navigate and complete the game. The BCI employs a code based visually- evoked potential (CVEP) paradigm, where specific visual cues trigger brain responses that are translated into in- game actions. By strategically coordinating their attention and mental focus on the visual cues while also managing keyboard controls, players can guide their characters through challenging levels and overcome obstacles. This innovative gameplay experience provides a dual-channel control system that combines traditional input methods with the exciting possibilities of BCI technology, offering players a novel and engaging way to interact with the game world.

## Open 'Platformer' from Unicorn Suite Hybrid Black

After the training session is finished. The dot in the upper right corner will change colors indicating the quality of the training run. A good training would turn the color of the dot to green, an acceptable training would turn it to yellow and a bad training run would turn it to red. Click 'continue' to start the game with or 'retrain' if you want to repeat the training in order to improve the training performance.

The goal of the game is to collect all coins and reach the finish area. You can move the avatar with the arrow keys of the keyboard. You can only collect all coins if you are able to focus on the flickering items and destroying them with the BCI. Only if you are able to control the keyboard and the BCI you are able to accomplish the game.

There are multiple phases for the puzzle game.
- **Connection phase**: Establishing the bluetooth connection between the unicorn hybrid black and the PC.
- **Charging phase**: Loading up your mental power (ie. train a classifier) to select puzzle pieces with BCI.
- **Game phase**

## Charging Session
After connecting to the device, the following screen will be shown to players.This session intended to train a classifier used for selecting puzzles with BCI. The whole charging session takes around 1 minute.
<p align="center">
<img src="./img/g20.png" alt="drawing" width="800"/><br/>
</p>

Some important points to note:
- The **topoplot** on the right indicates the signal quality of each EEG channel with positional information.

    - Green: Good EEG channel
    - Red: Bad EEG channel

- **Progress Bar** below `START!` button shows the state of charging, which increases overtime.
    <p align="center">
    <img src="./img/g26.png" alt="drawing" width="220"/>
    <img src="./img/g27.png" alt="drawing" width="200"/>
    <img src="./img/g28.png" alt="drawing" width="200"/>
    <br/>
    </p>
- `START!` button: When all EEG channels have good signal quality, press this button to **start the Charging session**.
- **MENTAL STATE** indicate how powerful you will be able to select the puzzle pieces later in the game. The number of stars will be updated after the charging session. The more stars you have, the better your BCI performance will be. See the following screenshot as reference.

    - 3 Stars: A perfect classifier. In 3-5 seconds, you will be able to pick a puzzle piece.
    - 2 Stars: An ok classifier. In 6-9 seconds, you can select a puzzle piece.
    - 1 Star: A bad classifier. You need to take more to 10 seconds to select a puzzle piece
