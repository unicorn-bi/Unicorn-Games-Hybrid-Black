# Brainbuddy

Developed during a BCI game jam 2022 for impaired children, this platformer game utilizes a brain-computer interface (BCI) for control. Players can engage in multiplayer mode, with one player controlling the character via keyboard input and the other using the BCI. Alternatively, the game can be played solo by simultaneously controlling the character with both the keyboard and BCI. The objective is to collect fruits scattered throughout the game world. Success relies on effectively coordinating control between the BCI and keyboard, making it necessary to master both input methods to complete the game. This inclusive and challenging gaming experience encourages cognitive and motor skill development while fostering cooperation in multiplayer gameplay.

Upon accessing the screen, you will find detailed instructions on how to maneuver the characters. You are presented with two options. You can either play solo utilizing the Brain-Computer Interface (BCI), where you focus on flashing objects to initiate actions. Simultaneously, you can use the keyboard for character movement, employing the W/A/S/D or Left/Right/UP/Down keys. Pressing the Up key (W) propels the character into a jump, while the left (A) and right (D) keys dictate directional movement. You can also play with a friend. So one person is using the BCI and the other one uses the keyboard.

# Platformer

In this unique platformer game, players must simultaneously control both the keyboard and a brain-computer interface (BCI) to successfully navigate and complete the game. The BCI employs a code based visually- evoked potential (CVEP) paradigm, where specific visual cues trigger brain responses that are translated into in- game actions. By strategically coordinating their attention and mental focus on the visual cues while also managing keyboard controls, players can guide their characters through challenging levels and overcome obstacles. This innovative gameplay experience provides a dual-channel control system that combines traditional input methods with the exciting possibilities of BCI technology, offering players a novel and engaging way to interact with the game world.
